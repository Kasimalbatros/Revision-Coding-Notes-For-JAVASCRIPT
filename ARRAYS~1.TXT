Arrays.


1 to 15 minutes notes:-

Var a=["a","b","c"];
console.log(a);

Now Change the Value of Particular index.(Called as Mutable Property.)
Arrays are mutable in javascript.

Simply Write..
a[1]=hello;
console.log(a);

now output is:-
a,hello,c

Above is an example to show that Arrays are mutable in javascript.

But Same thing in String data structure we are unable to perform because 
Strings are Immutable in Javascript.
