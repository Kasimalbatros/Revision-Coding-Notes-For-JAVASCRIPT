Ans:-

Our code takes how much OFF you want just type n value.

var a=[200,300,400,500,600];
var n=prompt("enter how much percent OFF you want to give  :");
for (var i=0;i<a.length;i++){
    var offer=a[i]*n/100;
    var zxc=a[i]-offer;
    console.log("Values after applying "+n+"% OFF in each Item  :-  "+zxc);
}

output:-

enter how much percent OFF you want to give  :20
Values after applying 20% OFF in each Item  :-  160
Values after applying 20% OFF in each Item  :-  240
Values after applying 20% OFF in each Item  :-  320
Values after applying 20% OFF in each Item  :-  400
Values after applying 20% OFF in each Item  :-  480
