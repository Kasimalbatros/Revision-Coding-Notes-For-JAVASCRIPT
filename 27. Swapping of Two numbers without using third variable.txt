27. Swapping of Two numbers without using third variable    ?


code...

function f(a,b){;
a = a + b; // Add both numbers and store the result in 'a'
b = a - b; // Subtract 'b' from the updated 'a' and store the result in 'b'
a = a - b; // Subtract the updated 'b' from the updated 'a' and store the result in 'a'
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
}
f(10,20)


output:-

20
10



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
logic behind above program...(Clearly Explained below)

initially thinks that 

a contains red water(a's value) 
b contains blue water(b's value)

1.a=a+b;

---> It means now a's value is red water + blue water;

2.b=a-b;

--->we know a's updated value is red water + blue water;
    so b's value sholud be red water + blue water;  - blue water
     now b's updated value is red water.	

3.a=a-b;

--->we know a's updated value is red water + blue water;
    we know b's updated value is red water;
    now a's value shold be red water + blue water;  - red water;
    a's value is blue water;

finally we got (Swapping Achieved)
a's value is blue water;
b's value is red water;
